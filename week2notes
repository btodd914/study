in order to create a new function you must first create a //prototype  above the main. Then create the funtion at the below the function declaration)

EX:
void PrintName(string q);
{
	 printf("hello %s\n", q);

}
int main(void)
{
    printf("Your Name Please:");
    string s= GetString();
    PrintName(s);
}


When declaring a variable the declaration will only apply in the most recent set of curly braces. If the variable is needed throughout the code you must declare it before all functions. 

strlen()= string length

toupper= captilizes a character (requires ctype.h library)
tolower=lower cases a char (requires ctype.h library)#includint
islower= checks to see if it is a lower case char

reference.cs50.net (reference page for syntax)
\0 represents 8 zero bits in a row which means that it is the end of a string
array- type of data structure (like a box) contiguous sequence of a data type that is back to back


.h stands for a header file
