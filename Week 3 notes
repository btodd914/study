argv: argument Vector (array)
argc: Argument count (int)
EX:
int main(int argc, string argv[])
    {
        printf("hello, %s\n," argv[1])

    }

argc tells when to quit in the array
argv is the different arrays
by using two [] roight next to eachother in an argv you are nesting in order to get a certain char in a certain string
